## Ingredients

- 11g Light roast arabica coffee
- 200mL Wather 85 - 99°C

## Quick notes
- For medium roast coffee, using 90-95°C water will give you better results.
- For dark roast coffee, try 85-90°C water for the brew
- Grind settings at finer end of medium. (Fellow Ode Gen. 2 3.0 - 3.5)

## Instructions

1. Set brewer in standard position on a server.
2. Start a timer, add 200mL water, aiming to wet all the coffee during pouring.
3. Then immediately place the plunger on top of the brewer, about 1cm in. This creates a vacuum to stop the coffee from dripping through.
4. Wait 2 minutes.
5. Holding the brewer and the plunger, gently swirl the brewer.
6. Wait 30 seconds.
7. Press gently all the way, it takes about 30 seconds.
